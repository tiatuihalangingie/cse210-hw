Adding files

git add myFile.txt

-only if you're using the same file but if you running
the git command from adifferent folder then you specify the full name of the
file, using either absolute or relative path.

git add csharp-prep/Prep1/Program.cs

or you simply use(remember the single period
represents the current directory); "

git add .


Committing files

git commit -m "Fixed problems where nother was 
displayed of the screen.
- it is important to choose a message that helps
you and the teamates know why you made the changes.
Especially if you track down the problem later.
Mind you git will not lwt you commit without a message.

When you don't type a message Git will take to a 
text editor called vim. If you want to exit, then
type :q! - q you want to quit and the ! says you 
are not worried about saving chages.

Pushing your changes to Github

Once you committed your changes to your local 
repository, you can pust them to Github

git push (git push origin main)
- we will only use git push because when you clone 
a repo from GitHub these will be set as defaults.
